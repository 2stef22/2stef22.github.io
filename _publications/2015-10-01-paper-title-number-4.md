title: "Understanding Operational Technology Personnel's Mindsets and Their Effect on Cybersecurity Perceptions: A Qualitative Study With Operational Technology Cybersecurity Practitioners"

#excerpt: 'In this paper, we conducted a critical analysis of the safety and security culture literatures, as well as 35 interviews with OT security professionals on the topic of security culture development. Accordingly, our findings demonstrate that both cultures share almost entirely overlapping enabling factors, such as top management leadership and involvement. Moreover, the successful development of safety culture informs security practitioners views on practices such as establishing security management systems and security communications.'

 <p>In this work, we analysed 72 interviews with OT cybersecurity practitioners, demonstrating a number of factors that shape OT personnel's mindsets, including the prioritisation of other operational values, operational challenges, and occupational pathways. In turn, we argue that these factors lead to cybersecurity misperceptions, which we categorised in two areas: technological misperceptions around the connectivity, obscurity, and “attractiveness as a target” of OT systems, and the stereotyping of occupational practices between IT and OT.</p>
 

 <h2>Abstract</h2><br>
 Operational Technology (OT) is hardware and software that monitor and control industrial processes in sectors such as water and energy. OT's increased digitalisation which expanded its attack surface, heightened institutional pressures including regulation, and the evolving threat landscape have compelled companies using OT to improve their cybersecurity. Security often clashes with employees’ values and hinders them from performing their primary job tasks, leading to its circumvention. OT personnel are a user group with distinctive characteristics, including the cyber-physical technology they use, and subsequently, their safety culture. Nevertheless, there's little research on how OT personnel's mindsets are formed, and in turn, how these mindsets affect their cybersecurity beliefs and behaviours. 
 As such, we have conducted 72 interviews with OT cybersecurity practitioners across various sectors on their experiences working with OT practitioners. Our analysis demonstrates a number of factors that shape OT personnel's mindsets: namely, the prioritisation of other operational values, operational realities and challenges, and their occupational pathways. In turn, these factors lead to misperceptions around cybersecurity, specifically in two areas: technological misperceptions, and the stereotyping of occupational practices between IT and OT. Accordingly, we discuss OT cybersecurity practitioners’ efforts to influence cybersecurity in these environments, and how the acknowledgment of these factors and misperceptions aids their efforts. Finally, we call for a better understanding of OT personnel's relationship with cybersecurity by proposing future research avenues.

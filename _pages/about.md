I am currently a Research Assistant at the University of Glasogw, working at the [Transit](https://transit.ac.uk/) project which focuses on digital twinning for decarbonising the transport industry. More specifically, I am interested in the organisational challenges that Digital Twins bring to companies, and more broadly, the digital challenges companies face in the development and adoption of Digital Twins.

I am also PhD Candidate in organisational cybersecurity at University College London (UCL), with a background
in computer science, supervised by [Prof. Jeremy Watson](https://petras-iot.org/person/prof-jeremy-watson/) and [Prof. Steve Hailes](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/about/head-department-professor-steve-hailes).


## Research

My PhD research is centred on the development of security culture in companies that use Operational Technology (OT), such as those in the water, energy, and transport sectors. Through qualitative methods, I have focused on the institutional and organisational factors that affect the development of a security culture. More specifically, I have investigated how external stakeholders (e.g., consultants, regulators, service providers) influence organisational practices, common organisational barriers to OT cybersecurity, the relationship between safety and security cultures, and the key factors that influence operational personnelâ€™s mindsets and interactions with cybersecurity.

## Education

## Personal

I was born and grew up in Nicosia, Cyprus. When I am not painstakingly working on my reserach, I like to spend my time cooking, reading, or in the quintessential British institution - the pub. Since moving to Glasgow, I have also gotten into long distance walking and hiking.
